This circuit is an example of a social distancing indicator and an alarming system, Generally speaking, the circuit detects the objects around it in a specific range ( 1 - 3 m ), so it gives an alarm when something is so close, Moreover it gives an indicator of how close the object is using special leds. Simple components were used to design this, starting from the basic Arduin UNO, a buzzer to give the alarm, ultrasonic sensor to measur the distance and that special leds component called NeoPixel Ring.
